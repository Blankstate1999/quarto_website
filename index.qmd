Welcome to my website.

I am a MSc Health Psychology student at the University of Bath, United Kingdom. I am currently on placement as a Research Assistant at the University of Bath, completing my masters dissertation.

My research interests include health psychology, digital health, and social inequalities.

From October I will be commencing a PhD exploring whether we can make digital health more effective for those in lower socioeconomic groups.

On this page, you'll also find links to my CV and social media. To contact me, click the Email button below.

I built this website on Quarto. To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.
