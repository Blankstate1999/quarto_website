I am currently a MSc Health Psychology student at the University of Bath on placement as a research assistant whilst completing my masters dissertation.

My research interests include health psychology, digital health, and health inequality; from October 2023 I will be starting a PhD at the University of Bath exploring how we can make digital health work better for those in lower socioeconomic groups.

Feel free to contact me using the links below.

I built this website on Quarto. To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.
