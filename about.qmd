title: "About me"
---

I'm Lee, a Health Psychology MSc student at the University of Bath. As part of my studies, I'm currently on placement as a Research Assistant in the Department of Health at Bath researching why digital devices for physical activity are less effective for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

In my other life I live in the Cotswolds with my husband, two kids, and cats Keith and Tweedy.
