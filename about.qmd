Hi there! I'm Lee, a Health Psychology MSc student at the University of Bath. Alongside my studies, I'm on placement as a Research Assistant in the Department of Health at Bath researching why digital devices for physical activity are less effective for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

I'm also a daddy - with husband, G - to two insanely brilliant but completely exhausting adopted children aged six (Child 1) and three (Child 2).
